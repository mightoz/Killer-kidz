Meeting Agenda

  Date: 2015-05-28
  Facilitator: Marie
  Participants: Everyone

1. Objectives 
There is a bug in the code that makes the program unrunnable. We fix it before continuing with the meeting.

2. Reports 
¤ Marie: Has implemented the HowToPlay view and added things in MMController to handle it.     
  Has been working with DizzyDoriz and RollingRascal, they are not finished yet though. 
  Has used STAN and Findbugs to clean up her code.
¤ Kim: Has used STAN and Findbugs to clean up the view and removed all circular dependencies. 
  Has made the project runnable with LibGDX, so it works with all OS’s that it should.
¤ Matilda: Has written levels and refactored to make STAN happy.
¤ Oscar: Has refactored both the model and the timer to remove all circular relationships in 
  STAN. Implemented candyFactory.
  
3. Discussion items 
¤ We need to make a folder for tests, should this be done in some special way?
¤ What happens when a level is finished?
¤ How should the candy store look, and who implements the different parts of it?
¤ Should we implement highscore?

4. Outcomes and assignments
Outcomes:
¤ We figured out how the controller and view gets to know when a level is finished.
¤ We decided how the candy shop should look and how to use it.
¤ We will implement highscore in case of time.
¤ When the code is finished, everyone will write at the RAD and SDD. 

Assignments: 
¤ Marie: Will finish the kids. Will write the controller and view part to candy shop.
¤ Kim: Will finish the GUI elements.
¤ Oscar: Will implement the model/controller part of candy shop.
¤ Matilda: Will write candy classes and perhaps another level.
¤ Everyone: Will refine their code and make tests for it. Will finish RAD and SDD.

5. Wrap up
