3. Discussion items 
Entity generateId method
Timer and controllers
Get the program to work
4. Outcomes and assignments
Outcomes:
We decided to make the method generateId() private
The controllers will be remade and will use two threads in order to make the updating of the game better.

Assignments: 
We will work together in order to get libGDXto work so that we can test our current code before we continue with other parts.
The next priority is to implement the new time controller and make the key controller compatible with libGDX and the view.
If there is time everyone will continue working on their previous parts.
