1. Objectives 
NA.

2. Reports 
Kim have started to remodify the whole view, and added a “basic” MainMenu and some  views to represent every “part” of the GameBoard, like candybar and it’s content (money, candy, currentLevel).
Marie has began to write a controller to handle events from the view, and thought of how to improve the controller responsible for key events.
Matilda have been working on getting the eventhandling from model to view to work (with an Observer-Pattern).
Oscar has extended the class JellyBean and working/restructed some models to work with future plans.
3. Discussion items 	
How we should solve an issue with how model should send events to views. An added model that will represent the “action” with candys,kids and the player (their positions).

4. Outcomes and assignments
We decided to have a gameboard in model. And we will send events from model to view with an method: notifyObservers(String id, int newPosX, int newPosY).

We decided to meet tomorrow in 6211 at 2 pm to merge together each part into one working program.
5. Wrap up

Next meeting will be on Friday 8th may 12:00 in 5205.
