  Participants: All

1. Objectives 
NA.

2. Reports 
Kim has made a picture of the view components we need, and a sketch of a new UML class diagram with MVC. 
Oscar has made an MVC UML class diagram. He has also created a project at Github.
Everyone have read about the MVC design pattern to improve their understanding of it.

3. Discussion items 
Decide the UML containing all the classes that we need for the first version. 
Decide what code we want for the first version, except the one we have already agreed on.
Decide who writes what code (not just for the first version).

4. Outcomes and assignments
Outcomes:
We agreed on a general UML of how the components of MVC interact.
Except the code we have already agreed on, we will also implement candy throwing and perhaps child spawning. 
So the classes we need are:
  Controller (with timer)
  Model
  Player
  Candy
  (Level)
  (Kid)
  GameView
  PlayFiedView
  PlayerView
  CandyView
  (KidView)

Assignments: Everyone writes their bit of the first version of the game.

5. Wrap up
Unresolved issues for next meeting: NA.

Time and place for next meeting: Monday 27 of April, 13:15 in 5215.
