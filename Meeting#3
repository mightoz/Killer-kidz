Meeting 3 Agenda

  Date: 2015-03-30
  Facilitator: Marie
  Participants: Kim, Marie, Matilda, Oscar

1. Objectives 
Kim explained what had been said at today's lecture, as none of the others was able to attend it.

2. Reports 
Matilda has written the user interface section in the RAD and added sketches into an appendix. Oscar has written 
the priority list for the use cases. Kim has completed  the “rough” UseCases diagram and the UseCases list. Marie 
has written section 1.1-1.3 in RAD.

3. Discussion items 
The following subjects were discussed:
   - What motor we want to use for the GUI
   - The domain model
   - If we should change properties of the candy

4. Outcomes and assignments
Outcomes:
   - We made a sketch of the domain model, to get a better overview of the classes we will need and how they 
     would be related.
   - We decided that instead of buying more copies of the candy in the candy shop, the player would be able to 
     upgrade the properties (e.g. speed) of the different candy types. This was done to prevent the risk that 
     the player would run out of candy, and as it seemed like an overall more reasonable way to implement the 
     game. 

Assignments:
   - Everyone: Learn more about different GUI motors
   - Everyone: Start to think of (and draw) an idea of the UML diagram (with MVC)
   - Oscar: Write in RAD about changes in candy properties 
   - Matilda: Draw new interface for candyshop
   - Marie: Make a better picture of the domain model and write some text about it (2.3.3)
   - Kim: RAD 1.4-1.5, 2.1, 2.2.1, look at 2.3.4

5. Wrap up
Unresolved issues for next meeting
   - What GUI motor to use
   - What to do during holidays and who does what

Time and location for next meeting: Wednesday 2015-04-01, 13:15 in M1222B.
